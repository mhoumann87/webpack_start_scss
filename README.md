# Webpack Start SCSS

Webpack starter files for a project with SCSS, PostCss and basic Javascript.
This setup works with dart-sass, and @use and @forward, and will generate a separate CSS file.

Delete the content of the scss files and index.js. That is just for demonstration.

To start the dev server use

```
npm start
yarn start
```

To make a production build use

```
npm run build
yarn run build
```
